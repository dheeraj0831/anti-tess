                    First of all, we would like to thank each and every student for uploading their screenshots and helping us bring this issue to the management. Your support has been invaluable. Unfortunately, the outcome was not in our favor.

                    No changes will be made to the evaluation of the Unit 1 and Unit 3 Tesseract Assessments. The same evaluation scheme will be followed for the Unit 4 Assessment, scheduled for the 2nd and 4th of July.

                    <li>The correction process for Mid Exams, Lab Internals, and Externals has been made stricter.</li>

                    <li>A new rule states that if liberal correction is found, the HODs and Faculty will be fined Rs. 5000/-.</li>
                    <li>Without executing lab experiments in internals and externals, students will be awarded 0 marks.</li>
                    <li>If a student fails any lab subject, the management is not responsible, and the student will have to re-register for the same in the next semester.</li>

                    The best two of the three assessments will be taken and their average will be considered for the final internal marks.

                <p className='text-xl mt-8'>
                    We have decided to stop fighting for this issue because if we push further, it might negatively affect the marks of every student, putting the other 90 marks and ultimately our future at risk.
